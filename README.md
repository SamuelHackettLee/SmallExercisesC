# SmallExercisesC
some smaller sets of problems solved with C. Here are summarys off the problems they are solving

**Kpermutations.c** - The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations. Given n and k, the program returns the kth permutation sequence.

**passwordCheck.c** - Program Checks the strength of a password. Given a string password, it will return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.
In one step, you can: Insert one character to password, Delete one character from password, or Replace one character of password with another character.
